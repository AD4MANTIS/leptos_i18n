# Introduction

This book is intended as an introduction to the [Leptos_i18n](https://github.com/Baptistemontan/leptos_i18n) crate.

This crate is made to simplify internalisation in a [Leptos](https://crates.io/crates/leptos) application, that load locales at **_compile time_** and provide compile time check for keys and selected locale.

This guide does assume you know some basics about `Leptos`, but the majority of the guide is about declaring the translations and how to use them, you can find the `Leptos` book [here](https://leptos-rs.github.io/leptos/).

You can find more detailed docs for each part of the API at [Docs.rs](https://docs.rs/leptos_i18n/latest/leptos_i18n/).

**Important Note**: This current version of the book reflects the upcoming `0.2.0` release, which you can install as version `0.2.0-rc`. Also note that this use `Leptos` upcoming `v0.5.0`

> The source code for the book is available [here](https://github.com/Baptistemontan/leptos_i18n/tree/main/docs/book). PRs for typos or clarification are always welcome.
